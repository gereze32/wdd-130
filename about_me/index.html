    I live in Argentina, in a state called San Luis and it is kind of in the middle of Argentina. <br>
    I have been married for about 12 years now and we have four beautiful kids in the range of 1 to 11 years <br>
    For 3 years now I lost my name in my ward cause I was called to serve as a bishop and now everybody in the church just calls me Bishop. <br> It is a wonderful challenge now in my life full of great rewards. <br>
    I have been working in a company that produces mayonnaise and pean butter for 10 years now and last year I received my certifications as an English professor degree. <br>
    I am studying for aplied technology degree cause I always loved programming.<br>
    Some years ago I took a Java web programming course but I never did anything about it. <br>
    I am 34 years old but feeling full of energy and I need it because I have many plans in my family life to carry on. <br>
