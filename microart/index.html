                Think of the great artworks that have been made in history and what makes them unique. My website aims to present great works of art with the singularity of being the smallest ever created in the world; in fact, they are so small that if we don't see them we don't believe it. The Webpage presents the artist (“Polo Jerez”), the technique, the tools, videos and his works of art made with his own hands and a possible schedule of exhibitions. Can you imagine a picture painted in a single grain of sugar? Possible? You have to see it! The astonishment, the interesting and the unique is guaranteed!

            When we hear the word "art", great sculptures, paintings by famous artists, and many times even works of art that we cannot understand or find their essence or meaning come to mind. Because much of art is reserved only for those who studied art and can understand what the artist wants to convey, the microscopic works of Polo Jerez can be understood, appreciated, and enjoyed with the naked eye and at first contact. Well, not so naked eye! They are so small that they can only be seen clearly through powerful magnifying glasses focusing on the work. It is not necessary to understand art to enjoy and be amazed by the works, but it is a bit hard to believe and many people come to wonder if it is not some optical illusion, trick or something like that and that is why they are presented in transparent capsules where you can glimpse a little with the naked eye to be able to compare and verify that the works are really there, made by a great talent and a great idea.
