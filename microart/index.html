            When we hear the word "art", great sculptures, paintings by famous artists, and many times even works of art that we cannot understand or find their essence or meaning come to mind. <br><br>Seems much of art is reserved only for those who studied art and can understand what the artist wants to convey, the microscopic works of Polo Jerez can be understood, appreciated, and enjoyed with the naked eye and at first contact. <br><br>Well, not so naked eye! They are so small that they can only be seen clearly through powerful magnifying glasses focusing on the work. <br><br>It is not necessary to understand art to enjoy and be amazed by the works, but it is a bit hard to believe and many people come to wonder if it is not some optical illusion or trick.<br><br>For that same reason is why the works are presented in transparent capsules where you can glimpse a little with the naked eye to be able to compare and verify that the works are really there.
