        Think of the great artworks that have been made 
        in history and what makes them unique!. <br><br> 
        MicroArt website aims to present great works of 
        art with the singularity of being the smallest ever created
        in the world; in fact, they are so small that if we don't see
        them we don't believe it. <br><br>The Webpage presents the 
        artist “Polo Jerez” with its technique, tools, videos presentation 
        and his art works, made with his own hands.<br><br> Can you 
        imagine a picture painted in a single grain of sugar?, Possible?, 
        You have to see it!.<br><br> The astonishment, the interesting 
        and unique is guaranteed!

     When we hear the word "art", great sculptures, paintings by famous 
     artists, and many times even works of art that we cannot understand 
     or find their essence or meaning come to mind. <br><br>Seems much of 
     art is reserved only for those who studied art and can understand 
     what the artist wants to convey, the microscopic works of Polo 
     Jerez can be understood, appreciated, and enjoyed with the naked 
     eye and at first contact. <br><br>Well, not so naked eye! They 
     are so small that they can only be seen clearly through powerful 
     magnifying glasses focusing on the work. <br><br>It is not necessary 
     to understand art to enjoy and be amazed by the works, but it is a
     bit hard to believe and many people come to wonder if it is not some 
     optical illusion or trick.<br><br>For that same reason is why the works
     are presented in transparent capsules where you can glimpse a little with
     the naked eye to be able to compare and verify that the works are really there.
