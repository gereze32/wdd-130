        <article>
           <p>
            Polo Jerez is one of the only artists in the world capable of creating works of art of extremely small size. With his own technique, his works themselves are an innovation in fine art. He performs the works only with his own hands and with the help of a powerful binocular loupe (something very similar to a microscope). Thanks to an incredible pulse, concentration and talent, he can create works on different surfaces and materials such as grains of sugar, grains of rice, pin heads, hand hair, hair, and even eyelashes where he writes and draws. His works then are varied and the collections can include paintings on sugar crystals, carvings on grains of rice (“The manger”), sculptures on pin heads, inside the eye of small needles and even sculptures of camels walking on hairs.

        <h3>Average size of works </h3>
        <h5> One square millimeter</h5>
         <article>
           <p>
            Polo Jerez has challenged itself to maintain an average size per work or parts of them of one square millimeter or less.

                The collections are not limited only to paintings, but also apply carving and sculpture, which are other artistic disciplines with which the artist enjoys creating in the microscopic world. And as if all this were not enough, among the collections the artist has managed to innovate and create amazing works where the public can interact with them; as is the case with one of his works where visitors can turn on the light inside a picturesque little house built on the head of a small pin. In this particular work, the lighting engineers still don't understand how he managed to fit light into something so small. Since his childhood, Polo Jerez has been drawn to the idea of smallness and the challenge of creating very tiny art.

                Although the artist can draw and paint, even larger works and artistic carvings, it is his passion for the small that has taken him a lifetime to perfect his technique, doing a lot of research and trying many times until he feels comfortable working into a microscopic scale.
