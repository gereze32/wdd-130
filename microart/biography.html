          <h3 >Artist Polo Jerez</h3>
           <p class="p-b-1">
            Polo Jerez is one of the only artists in the world 
            capable of creating works of art of extremely small size.
            With his own technique, his works themselves are an 
            innovation in fine art. He performs the works only with 
            his own hands and with the help of a powerful binocular 
            loupe (something very similar to a microscope). Thanks 
            to an incredible pulse, concentration and talent, he can 
            create works on different surfaces and materials such 
            grains of sugar, grains of rice, pin heads, hand hair, 
            hair, and even eyelashes where he writes and draws. 
            His works then are varied and the collections can 
            include paintings on sugar crystals, carvings on grains
            of rice (“The manger”), sculptures on pin heads, 
            the eye of small needles and even sculptures of camels
            walking on hairs.

          <h2>“Most choose a conventional art, but I wanted to do 
               something unique and different, something very small and 
                at the same time” -Polo Jerez-
          </h2>

        <h4>About Talent</h4>
             <p>
                The collections are not limited only to paintings, 
                but also apply carving and sculpture, 
                which are other artistic disciplines with which 
                the artist enjoys creating in the microscopic world. 
                And as if all this were not enough, among the 
                collections the artist has managed to innovate and 
                create amazing works where the public can interact 
                with them; as is the case with one of his works
                where visitors can turn on the light inside a 
                picturesque little house built on the head of a 
                small pin. In this particular work, the lighting
                engineers still don't understand how he managed to 
                fit light into something so small. Since his 
                childhood, Polo Jerez has been drawn to the idea 
                of smallness and the challenge of creating very 
                tiny art.

                Although the artist can draw and paint, 
                even larger works and artistic carvings, it is his 
                passion for the small that has taken him a lifetime 
                to perfect his technique, doing a lot of research 
                and trying many times until he feels comfortable 
                working into a microscopic scale.
