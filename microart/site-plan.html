      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Think of the great artworks that have been made in history and what makes them unique.
        My website aims to present great works of art with the singularity of being the smallest ever created in the world; in fact, they are so small that if we don't see them we don't believe it. The Webpage presents the artist (“Polo Jerez”), the technique, the tools, videos and his works of art made with his own hands and a possible schedule of exhibitions. Can you imagine a picture painted in a single grain of sugar? Possible? You have to see it!
        The astonishment, the interesting and the unique is guaranteed!
        </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The page seeks to reach influencers and businessmen or people with influences who may have a fairly broad idea of the works and thus close purchase agreements, exhibitions, or similar events.
        On the other hand,  is not aimed at a professional audience of art critics, but rather tries to reach an audience that does not necessarily have to understand art but knows how to value when there is talent in realizing artwork and achieving admiration for it, so the general public, ages can range from children moved by curiosity and wonder, to adults who can enjoy something interesting and amazing.
