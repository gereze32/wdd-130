        <p>Part of his secret is to get into a lot of concentration, lower his heart rate and breathing to the minimum possible level to the point of practically not moving, and finally, work between heartbeats since it is the only vibration impossible to avoid in the pulse of the hand. The technique that he uses is unique since it is simply a talent developed with a lot of practice and a lot of patience. In fact, tools such as cutters, paints, sculpting materials or tweezers are all created by the artist and in many cases for each new idea, the artist must investigate, try different materials, create new tools, and discover new things in each new project.</p>

            <p>Polo Jerez has come to understand that in such a tiny world, materials behave differently and every little detail is a very small detail. a little sigh and the work can disappear in from the artist's eyes! Among the limited exhibitions that have been made of the collections, the impact generated in the visitors is always amazement and the repeated phrase among them: "I have seen something unique, and incredible that I will never forget"</p>
